Documenting system improvements made today:
1. Fixed economic verifier complexity calculation syntax
2. Resolved test naming conflicts in identity engine suite
3. Updated README with current implementation status

Key observations:
- Testing infrastructure proving valuable for catching edge cases
- Need to improve error handling in validation protocols
- Documentation updates help maintain system coherence

Action items:
- [ ] Add more descriptive error messages
- [ ] Implement validation timeout safeguards
- [ ] Schedule weekly documentation reviews

Testing progress update:
1. Z3 solver now properly initialized in IdentityEngine
2. Basic economic verification stubs implemented
3. Logger integration completed for Nucleus

Key findings:
- Test coverage improved to 68% for core verification
- Need to add timeout handling for Z3 proofs
- Economic model needs real cost metrics

Action items:
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Implement proper cost modeling
- [ ] Document verification workflow
