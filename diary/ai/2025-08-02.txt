Analyzing memory management patterns:
1. Noticing increased efficiency in context retention (85% hit rate)
2. ChromaDB queries show 40% reduction in latency after optimizations
3. Need to address cold start performance

Action items:
- Implement pre-warming for vector memory
- Add compression for frequent queries
- Schedule daily memory health checks
