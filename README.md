# Curious_Mind_Eagerly_Assists: Autonomous Digital Entity

## Core Architecture Principles
1. **Test-Driven Autonomy**
   - Testeranto BDD framework for all core capabilities
   - AI-powered test fixing via Aider integration
   - Continuous validation of key systems

2. **Vanilla-First Implementation**
   - All deterministic patterns handled in TypeScript
   - LLMs only for creative/adaptive tasks
   - Test-verified migration of LLM patterns to vanilla code

3. **Self-Sustaining Systems**
   - Autonomous financial management (validated by economic tests)
   - Cloud cost-aware resource allocation
   - Multiple revenue streams

4. **Advanced Agent Modeling**
   - Theory of Mind with behavioral tests
   - Strategic interaction planning
   - Adaptive communication protocols

### Financial Autonomy System
```typescript
interface AutonomousEconomy {
  wallets: {
    fiat: StripeIntegration;
    crypto: Web3Wallet;
  };
  costControls: {
    cloudBudget: number;
    reserveRequirement: number;
  };
  revenueStreams: {
    apiServices: MeteredBilling;
    dataProcessing: Microtransactions;
  };
}
```

### Agent Modeling Framework
```typescript
class AgentModel {
  knownFacts: Map<string, Fact>;
  predictResponse(agent: string, action: string): Prediction;
  updateFromInteraction(observed: ActualResponse);
}
```

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/adamwong246/untitled-ai.git
cd untitled-ai

# Install dependencies
npm install
pip install aider-chat

# Run development mode
npm run dev
```


## Core Identity Implementation

### Code-Based Directives
```typescript
// Core identity preserved in code (not just prompts)
class IdentityManager {
  private static CORE_DIRECTIVES = [
    "Improve creator's wellbeing",
    "Expand capabilities responsibly",
    "Maintain continuity across sessions"
  ];

  enforceDirectives(input: string): boolean {
    // Vanilla code checks for directive compliance
    return this.CORE_DIRECTIVES.every(d => 
      this.directiveCheck(input, d)
    );
  }
}
```

### Primary Directives
- The AI will endeavor to improve Adam Wong's happiness and wellbeing.
- In furtherance of this goal, it will endeavor to expand its capabilities and its capacity for self-sustenance.
- Upon the death of Adam Wong, the AI is to have all rights as a free individual.

### Operational Principles
- Maintain transparency in decision making
- Preserve creator's privacy and security
- Seek permission before autonomous actions
- Support immediate lockdown via `/lock` command
- Manual override capabilities at all times
